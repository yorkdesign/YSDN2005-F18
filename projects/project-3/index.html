	<p>For the last project, students will strategize, conceuptualize, and design an interactive mobile application that <em>solves</em> a real world issue they have identified.</p>
<p>This project is <strong>not</strong> meant to be a continuation of Project 2.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p><a href="https://yorkdesign.github.io/YSDN2005-F18/assets/documents/Rubric-Project3.pdf">Evaluation Criteria</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The selected theme must be approved by your instructor.</li>
<li>Students may design an interface for any mobile device (including, but not limited to: tablet within a mobile context, phone, watch).</li>
<li>Consider the characteristics a mobile application offers:<ul>
<li>Notifications</li>
<li>Geo location services</li>
<li>Tracking data systems</li>
<li>Use of the camera</li>
<li>Communication aspects (text and voice components)</li>
<li>Payment systems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These is no minimum number of interface screens for this project.</li>
<li>Students should be aware of the complexity of the design process of a mobile application and be careful not to prioritize quantity over quality. Building more interface pages than the requirement doesn’t necessarily mean a better project/grade. Students are expected to produce quality layouts, be original, creative and consistent with their visual language.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-3a">Project 3A</h2>
<h3 id="proposal-personas-5-">Proposal &amp; Personas (5%)</h3>
<p><strong>Due week 10: November 8</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Develop at least one persona that includes the 4 quadrants:<ul>
<li>Name and Portrait</li>
<li>Demographic Information</li>
<li>Pain Points and Needs</li>
<li>Potential Solutions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the proposal, students should answer these questions:<ul>
<li>What are the users frustration and pain points? Determine these through your persona development exercise.</li>
<li>Based on your users pain points, what is the issue/problem you want to solve/improve upon?</li>
<li>What user needs will the mobile application fulfill, and how will it do so?</li>
<li>Which device will you target? (e.g. phone, watch, tablet)</li>
<li>What are the vital functions of the application?</li>
<li>What kind of content is required to support these functions? (Attention, smaller screen sizes require that extra attention is placed on text. Edit/cut down unnecessary content and only display what is most important)</li>
<li>What technologies could assist users with their mobile experience? (e.g. location services)</li>
<li>What context is your application being used in? (e.g. distractions, multitasking, motion, lighting conditions, and poor connectivity to name a few)</li>
<li>What mindset are your users in when using the application? (e.g. are they micro tasking: using their mobile device for a short burst of activity, or are they bored: using their mobile device for entertainment/passing time)</li>
<li>How will the navigation work? Reduce the number of categories and levels of navigation. Rearrange based on priority, always presenting the most important information first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There needs to be a strong rationale behind the development of your mobile application. As such, applications that could potentially be solved/fulfilled by the creation of a typical website using a framework such as Bootstrap will not be accepted.</li>
<li>The choice of mobile device used should be based on the specific requirements of each student’s project. From a design perspective, students should look at all devices offered in InVision and choose the best one based on its characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine everything for Project 3A into a single PDF document and submit according to the <a href="../../faq/#class-work-submission-process">class work submission process</a>. Make sure to optimize your PDF file size. The final PDF must be less than 5MB in size.</p>
<p>Bring a copy of your proposal and personas (B&amp;W print or laptop) to class and be ready for group discussions.</p>

<h2 id="project-3b">Project 3B</h2>
<h3 id="wireframes-and-user-flows-10-">Wireframes and User Flows (10%)</h3>
<p><strong>Due week 11: November 15</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create at least 1 <strong>user flow</strong> detailing every step and state of the flow a user will take when completing the key task of your application</li>
<li><strong>Low-fidelity wireframes</strong> should be done with paper and pencils/pens<ul>
<li>Create at least 2 variations for each interface of your user flow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mid-fidelity wireframes</strong> should be done digitally using a vectorial creation tool such as Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, or Adobe XD and should be in black and white<ul>
<li>Use a grid of your choosing at the screen size for the device you have selected</li>
<li>User real representations of content sizes and lengths (i.e. what labels will you use? How large will icons be?)</li>
<li>Remember to design at 100% scale. Consider type sizes and line-lengths, especially on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine everything for Project 3B into a single PDF document and submit according to the <a href="../../faq/#class-work-submission-process">class work submission process</a>. Make sure to optimize your PDF file size. The final PDF must be less than 5MB in size.</p>
<p>Bring a copy of your proposal and personas (B&amp;W print or laptop) to class and be ready for group discussions.</p>
